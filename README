Simple program that uses the ARB_get_program_binary extension to retrieve the internal representation of an OpenGL GLSL shader.  This was mostly meant as an experiment to see what intermediate language GPU drivers compiled GLSL to.

Note that while ARB_get_program_binary is core in OpenGL 4, it's still available as an extension on most OpenGL 3 implementations.

Includes the Pez library by Philip Rideout.

Requires GLEW >= 1.5.6, or compilation will fail complaining about undefined symbols from ARB_get_program_binary.
